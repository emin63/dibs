* (EM) (release 0.93)

**  Added a GUI

**  Changed version number to 0.93.

* (EM) (release 0.92) 

**  Added Peer Finder service to allow advertising and automated
    exchange of peering information.  See manual for details.

**  Updated add_peer and edit_peer commands to allow sizes to
    be specified using k, m, g, t (e.g., 10k, 10m, 10g, 10t).

**  Updated the protocol DIBS uses to exchange store, unstore, probe,
    and other messages between peers.  The new protocol is XML based
    to allow easier debugging, parsing, and extensions.

**  Fixed a deadlock bug reported by Jason Martin in a message to
    the dibs-discussion mailing list 
    (https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=9092728).

**  Made the daemon run its periodic checks like spawnning auto_check,
    process_message, etc., as soon as it starts up.

**  Other minor bug fixes and improvements

* (EM) (release 0.91)

** Added probe functions to check if peers are really storing the stuff
   they claim to store.

** Added some statistics tracking features to DIBS. Specifically, the
   merge_stats command was added.  

** Added automatic log rotation.

** Made it so that the various databases first get written out to
   <fileName>.CRASH and then get moved to <fileName> to help recover
   from system crashes.

** Added the send_hello command which can be used to 'ping' a 
   DIBS daemon to see if it is alive and what protocol version it uses.

** Added a stop_daemon command which stops the daemon as soon as the
   daemon finishes current processing and has time to 'hear' the stop
   request.

** Added more options for the 'show_database --only ...' command.

** Added step-by-step instructions for a windows install

** Fixed a bug (I think) that seemed to be causing RemoteFileNonExistent 
   errors. See the comments in the StoreFile function in dibs_main.py
   for details.

* (EM) (release 0.9)

** Added the recover_all command which lets a user ask all peers to
   send back all pieces they are storing for that user.  This command
   allows a user to recover from a complete loss of data using only
   the cryptographic key and a list of peers.

** Added the capability for the user to control how much information
   is logged by introducing 5 levels of severity for messages.

** Fixed a bug in how data is distributed to peers.  The old incorrect
   behavior was that a peer always gave pieces to the peer with the highest
   remaining storage.  Now a peer tries to cycle through the different
   peers if possible.  This fixes bug ID 796359 reported on
   sourceforge.

** Fixed a bug which would cause DIBS to crash if certain portions of
   the database were missing.  Now DIBS prints a warning and initializes
   the missing database portion to be empty.  This was required to
   make the recover_all command able to recover from a total loss of data.
  
** Added more automated tests to verify the bug fixes and test the new
   recover_all command.

** Got rid of QUICKSTART in favor of centralizing all installation and
   configuration information in the manual.

* (EM) (release 0.81)

This is a bugfix release designed to get DIBS working on Windows.

** The DIBS start script name was changed from "dibs" to "dibs.py" so 
   that Windows would associate the script with the Python interpreter.

** Implemented the changes suggested by Daniel Smith in his
   post to the Open Discussion forum on sourceforge on 2003-05-06

** Hacked the commands.py module to make dibs_mod_commands.py
   so that getstatusoutput works on windows.

** Added the smtpServer option in dibs_options.py so that users
   can specify a custom smtp server if localhost doesn't work.

** Got rid of makefile and old install procedure and replaced
   with setup.py and distutils install.

** Made reading and writing of files use 'rU' or 'wU' to
   deal with windows CRLF.

** Added code to deal with spaces or colons in file names.

* (EM) Mon Apr 21, 2003 (release 0.8)

* The new command cleanup has been added.

* DIBS now does incremental storage of directories via
  the command "dibs store --name DIR".  Specifically, this
  command looks at each file and in DIR and stores it if it has
  not previously been stored, or if it has been stored but the
  current version has changed.

* The store_file command has been replaced with the store command.
  Furthermore the store command takes the argument --name instead
  of --file and can also take the optional argument --as.

* The send_message command can now be called with no arguments
  in which case it tries to send all outgoing messages.

* The process_message command can now be called with no arguments
  in which case it tires to process all incoming messages.

* The dibsKeyName option in dibsrc.py has been replaced with
  the dibsPublicKey and dibsPrivateKey options.  If you set
  the dibsKeyName option, you MUST replace it with
  the dibsPublicKey option and ALSO set dibsPrivateKey.

* The tarCmd and tarOpts options were removed.

* The dibs_backup.py file has been removed due to some code cleanup.

* Cryptography functions have been moved into the new file dibs_crypto.py

* If the something connected to the dibs daemon which did not speak the
  DIBS protocol, the daemon used to die.  Now, it mails you a message
  indicating the problem, but stays alive.

* Reed-Solomon encoding was sped up by adding a lookup table for multiply
  and divide operations in ffield.py

* The database is saved after each file is stored in case an error occurs
  during a long recursive store.

* (EM) Fri Feb 21, 2003 (release 0.7)

** Added Reed-Solomon coding to provide RAID-like use of
   reduandant data.  See the FAQ or the manual for more details.

** Added a makefile so that "make install" installs the
   dibs files into /usr/local (or wherever the user wants).

** If "make install" is used, the user can now run DIBS
   using the command "dibs" intead of 'dibs_ui.py".

* (EM) Sat Feb 08, 2003 (release 0.6)
A number of bugs and misfeatures were fixed.  

** Clarified the installation and configuration procedure in QUICKSTART.

** Fixed a bug with port being used as an integer though it was a string.

** Fixed a bug where the recover command decreased remote storage.

** Made the outgoing queue dir use the peer name instead of email addr.

** Added edit_peer, delete_peer and forget commands.

** Added more tests

** Fixed the process_message and send_message commands so that if an
   error occurs, they move the offending file to a temporary directory.

** Made incoming/outgoing file names start with creation time in ms.

* (EM) Sun Feb 02, 2003 (release 0.5)
A number of bugs and misfeatures were fixed.  

** The user interface now looks a little more standard in that options
   are passed with -- (e.g., --file foo.txt).

** More documentation was added.

** An automated test was added in the tests/daemon directory.

** The add_peer command now interprets the local_quota and
   remote_quota values as kilo-bytes not bytes.

** Bugs in trying to grab environment variables in dibs_options.py
   were fixed.

* (EM) Thu Jan 02, 2003
Added socket based communication to replace email, fixed some bugs,
and added documentation.
