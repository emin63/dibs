The following are issues which need to be fixed in future releases.  If
you have other suggestions or would like to fix something in the list
below, please contact @email{emin@@alum.mit.edu}.

@table @bullet

@item Provide options to the show_database command
Current show_database prints the entire database.  This is annoying if
you just want to check data about a certain file or a certain peer.
We need to provide some options to show_database to let you just get
small amounts of info.

@item GUI
It would be nice to improve the GUI.

@item Peer finding server
To facilitate finding peers, it would be nice to have a central server
which DIBS peers can automatically post requests for and complete
peering aggreements.  By automatically, I mean that the user should
just be able to tell his DIBS program that he wants to find peers with
certain properties and the program should take care of the rest.

@item More automated tests
We need more automated tests to find and squash the bugs in DIBS.

@item Use py2exe

Travis made a good point that it DIBS would be easier to use if the
DIBS installer could install python and GPG for the user instead of
requiring the user to install those packages separetely.

@item If you want to clear out peers and one of them is not responding,
DIBS quits without sending clear messages to the other peers.  This 
should be fixed.

@end table
